# ai_graph_search

This project explores some graph searching algorithms for solving the cannibal and missionary problem described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem">here</a> as an attempt to get started with AI. The graph search algorithms explored are breadth first, depth first, iterative deepening depth first, and A-star.

This is a pretty rough draft used for experimental purposes, so switching between the search methods used and the initial states for the search involves hardcoding the changes.
